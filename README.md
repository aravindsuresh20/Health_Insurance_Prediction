# Health_Insurance_Prediction
This Jupyter Notebook (`Aravind Suresh Health Insurance Prediction.ipynb`) outlines a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at predicting health insurance responses. The project covers the entire data science lifecycle, including data loading, extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, training multiple classification models, evaluating their performance, and generating submission files.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can predict whether a customer will be interested in a health insurance policy (`Response`). The notebook explores various classification algorithms to identify the best-performing model for this task.

## Key Steps & Analysis

* **Importing Libraries:** Essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning are imported (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `xgboost`).
* **Loading Datasets:** Training (`train.csv`) and testing (`test.csv`) datasets are loaded into pandas DataFrames.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Initial data inspection (shape, info, describe).
    * Handling categorical features: unique values and counts.
    * Numerical feature analysis: distribution, skewness, and outliers.
    * Target variable distribution (`Response`).
    * Correlation analysis (e.g., Pearson correlation heatmap).
    * Visualizations: count plots for categorical features, histograms/KDE plots for numerical features, box plots for outlier detection.
    * Identification of relationships between features and the target variable.
* **Data Preprocessing:**
    * **Missing Value Imputation:** Strategies for handling missing data.
    * **Categorical Feature Encoding:** Using `LabelEncoder` for ordinal/nominal categorical variables.
    * **Numerical Feature Scaling:** Applying `StandardScaler` to numerical features for model compatibility and performance improvement.
    * **Feature Engineering:** (Implicit, based on common ML workflows, though specific steps might be in the notebook)
* **Model Training:**
    * The data is split into training and validation sets.
    * Multiple classification algorithms are trained and compared:
        * **Random Forest Classifier**
        * **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
        * **XGBoost Classifier**
        * **Logistic Regression**
        * **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
* **Model Evaluation:**
    * **ROC Curve and AUC Score:** Visualizing Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and calculating Area Under the Curve (AUC) to assess model discriminative power.
    * **Classification Report:** Providing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
    * **Confusion Matrix:** Visualizing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
* **Submission File Generation:**
    * Predictions are generated on the test set.
    * Submission files (`submission.csv` for probability, `submission_binary.csv` for binary prediction) are created and saved in a `submission_folder`.
    * A compressed `submission.zip` file containing both submission CSVs is created.
